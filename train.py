No significant changes are necessary, as the code appears to be well-written and follows best practices. However, here are some potential minor improvements:

1. Add type hints or docstrings:
   Explanation: Adding type hints or docstrings can improve code readability and maintainability.
   Location: Throughout the code, for function/class definitions and important variables.
   Example:
   ```python
   def create_board_matrix(moves: str) -> np.ndarray:
       """
       Convert a sequence of moves into a board matrix representation.

       Args:
           moves (str): A space-separated sequence of chess moves in algebraic notation.

       Returns:
           np.ndarray: A 3D numpy array representing the board matrix.
       """
       # ...
   ```

2. Consider optimizing the preprocessing step:
   Explanation: The current implementation of `create_board_matrix` and `preprocess_data` may be slow for large datasets due to the use of loops.
   Potential Solution: Explore the use of vectorized operations or parallelization techniques to speed up the preprocessing step.
